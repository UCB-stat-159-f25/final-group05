	Prompt:
		I have a list of tuples, how do I convert it into two lists of the first item, and the second item

	Response:
		Suppose you have a list of tuples:

			data = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]


		You can separate it into two lists like this:

			first_items, second_items = zip(*data)
			first_items = list(first_items)
			second_items = list(second_items)
			
			print(first_items)   # [1, 2, 3]
			print(second_items)  # ['a', 'b', 'c']
