# Final Project: Analysis of Executive Orders
In this project, we analyze executive orders (EOs) from 1994-2025. The dataset can be on the U.S. Government Open Data Portal as well as in this repository as executive_orders.csv. We perform various types of frequency analyses such as looking at the quantity of EOs over time as well as the frequency of certain types over time. We also identify a data integrity related issue when analyzing the publication delay. Most of the analysis can be found in main.ipynb.
